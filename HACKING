This project uses Xcode's cross-project dependencies. If you're using
Xcode and are hacking on this program, then you also need to make sure
that you:

    1. Check out a version of http://code.brautaset.org/SBAlphaBeta into
       the same directory.

    2. Have set Xcode to put build products in a common location. I use
       /tmp/build, but you are free to chose something else.
