<h1>Desdemona 0.1 Help</h1>

<p>Desdemona is a Cocoa version of the popular game of Reversi (aka Othello&#174;).</p>

<h2>How to play</h2>

<p>The game of Reversi is played by two players, in this case you and Desdemona (an AI), each taking turn to put coloured disks onto the board. You can only place a disk on the board if one or more of Desdemona's disks are trapped between it and one of your existing disks; you then capture her disk(s) and turn them to your colour.</p>

<p>A player that cannot capture any of his opponent's disks have to forfeit his move. When neither player can place any disks the game is over. The winner is the player with the most disks on the board in his or her colour. </p>
