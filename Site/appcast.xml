            <title>Desdemona 0.4.1</title>
            <description><![CDATA[
            
                <p><em>Version 0.4 had a serious bug in which it would
                only run on my machine, because I had failed to bundle
                all the necessary libraries with the application.
                Sorry about that!</em></p>

                <p>Fixed a nasty bug in the AI which could lead it to
                make strange (and terrible) moves near the end of the
                game. Also fixed an error in the search optimisation
                code that caused the AI to perform much weaker than it
                should be.</p>

                <p>Given the latter fix I also took the opportunity to
                overhaul the difficulty levels. There was too little
                difference between them. The same range of levels from
                1-10 is available, but they now represent a wider
                range of ability in the AI.</p>

                <p>Difficulty level 1 is about the same as it was
                before. However, at level 10 it will now take about 22
                seconds to search for a move, up from about 10 seconds
                previously. (Because of the bugfixes, however, the
                versions prior to 0.4 would have to use about <em>5
                minutes or more</em> to perform as well!)</p>

                <p>Sorry! I had faile to include all the necessary
                libraries in the .app, so it would only run on my
                machine. Don't try to install this.</p>

                <p>Fixed a bug regarding pass moves that could cause you
                to be stuck in an infinite loop of modal dialogues.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>Fixed a bug that caused the default values for
                the preferences not to be registered. This could cause
                the AI level and board size to be used uninitialised,
                and could lead to crashes.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cleaned up the interface somewhat and put some of the 
                    existing clutter in a preferences pane.</li>
                <li>Added a progress indicator for things that go on in the background.</li>
                <li>Added a "Check for updates" menu item to check if new 
                    versions are available, using the wonderful <a
                    href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle</a>
                    framework. You also have the option to automatically check
                    for new versions on startup.</li>
                </ul>
